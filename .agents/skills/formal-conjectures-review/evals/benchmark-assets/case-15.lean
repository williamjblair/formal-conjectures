# Conjectures associated with A110854

$a(n) = \mathrm{prime}(2n+2) - \mathrm{prime}(2n+1) - \mathrm{prime}(2n) + \mathrm{prime}(2n-1)$,
where $\mathrm{prime}(k)$ is the $k$-th prime number.

The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is $\mathrm{prime}(2n+2) - \mathrm{prime}(2n+1) - \mathrm{prime}(2n) + \mathrm{prime}(2n-1)$.

Do the absolute values cover A004275?
A004275 is the set of all differences between two prime numbers.
The conjecture asks whether every possible difference between two prime numbers
occurs as the absolute value of some term $a(n)$.
