The Poisson Conjecture $PC_n$ ([AvdE07], Notations 5) asserts that, over a field of
characteristic zero, every endomorphism of the `n`-th canonical Poisson algebra
$P_n(K)$ — the polynomial algebra $K[X_1, \dots, X_{2n}]$ equipped with the canonical
Poisson bracket — is an automorphism.

By [AvdE07], Theorem 7 (the "United Conjectures Theorem"), for every `n` there is a chain
of implications
$$JC_{2n} \Longrightarrow PC_n \Longrightarrow DC_n \Longrightarrow JC_n,$$
where $JC_n$ is the Jacobian Conjecture in dimension `n` and $DC_n$ the Dixmier Conjecture
for the `n`-th Weyl algebra (the implication $DC_n \Longrightarrow JC_n$ being classical [BCW82]).
Since the Jacobian conjecture was disproved in dimension $3$ [Alp26] — and hence in every
dimension $n ≥ 3$ by padding with identity coordinates — $PC_n$ is false for all $n ≥ 3$:
composing the counterexample's failure of $JC_3$ through $PC_3 \Longrightarrow DC_3 \Longrightarrow JC_3$ refutes
$PC_3$, and directly, the cotangent (symplectic) lift of the counterexample map
([AvdE07], Theorem 1 in reverse) is a non-invertible Poisson endomorphism of $P_3(K)$.
The cases $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ remain open.

Indexing note: we index the $2n$ variables of $P_n(K)$ by `Fin n ⊕ Fin n`, with
`Sum.inl i` playing the role of $X_i$ and `Sum.inr i` the role of $X_{i+n}$ of [AvdE07],
so that the canonical bracket reads $\{X_i, X_{i+n}\} = 1$; see
`MvPolynomial.poissonBracket`.

/-- A `K`-algebra endomorphism `φ` of the polynomial algebra in $2n$ variables is an
endomorphism of the `n`-th canonical Poisson algebra $P_n(K)$ if it preserves the canonical
Poisson bracket. Following [AvdE07], Lemma 2, it is equivalent to require preservation on
the generators only, which is the form used here (the brackets of generators are constants,
so preserving and intertwining them agree). -/

/-- The Poisson Conjecture in dimension `n` ($PC_n$ in the notation of [AvdE07]): every
endomorphism of the `n`-th canonical Poisson algebra over `K` is an automorphism.
An endomorphism is an automorphism iff it is bijective, since the inverse of a bijective
algebra endomorphism preserving the Poisson bracket is again such. -/

The **Poisson Conjecture** ([AvdE07], the characteristic zero case): for every `n`, every
endomorphism of the `n`-th canonical Poisson algebra over a field `K` of characteristic
zero is an automorphism. This is **false**: the Jacobian conjecture fails in dimension $3$
[Alp26], hence so does $PC_3$ (via [AvdE07], Theorem 7, or directly via the symplectic
lift of the counterexample map).

The Poisson Conjecture in dimension $1$ ($PC_1$) is open. By [AvdE07], Theorem 7, it is
implied by the Jacobian conjecture in dimension $2$ (Keller's original problem, open) and
implies the Dixmier conjecture for the first Weyl algebra (Problem 1 of Dixmier (1968),
open).

The Poisson Conjecture in dimension $2$ ($PC_2$) is open. Since the Jacobian conjecture is
false in every dimension $n ≥ 3$ [Alp26], no known implication bounds $PC_2$ from above
any more; the chain of [AvdE07], Theorem 7 places it as the strongest of the remaining
open conjectures $PC_2 \Longrightarrow DC_2 \Longrightarrow JC_2 \Longrightarrow PC_1 \Longrightarrow DC_1$.

The Poisson Conjecture is false in dimension $3$: the cotangent (symplectic) lift
$\Phi(X_i) = F_i$, $\Phi(X_{i+3}) = \sum_j M_{ij} X_{j+3}$ with $M = (JF)^{-\top}$ of the
degree-$6$ counterexample map $F$ of [Alp26] (whose Jacobian determinant is the constant
$-2$, so $M$ is a polynomial matrix) is a Poisson endomorphism of $P_3(K)$ that is not
injective on points — e.g. it identifies $(0, 6, -142, 0, 0, 0)$ and $(1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0)$
— and is therefore no automorphism. Alternatively, $PC_3$ fails by [AvdE07], Theorem 7,
as it implies the Jacobian conjecture in dimension $3$, contradicting [Alp26].
