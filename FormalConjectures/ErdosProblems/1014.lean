/--
Let $R(k,l)$ be the Ramsey number, so the minimal $n$ such that every graph on at least $n$
vertices contains either a $K_k$ or an independent set on $l$ vertices.

Prove, for fixed $k\geq 3$, that
$$\lim_{l\to \infty}\frac{R(k,l+1)}{R(k,l)}=1.$$

This has been
[solved](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/6dc7175d-d9e7-4b8d-96b8-48fe5798cd5b/Ramsey.pdf)
by an internal model at OpenAI.

That proof in fact shows that
$$R(k,l+1)\leq (1+O(l^{-c/k^2}))R(k,l)$$
for some constant $c>0$.
