Let $f(n;r,k)$ be the maximal number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph which contains no set of $k$ many independent edges.

For all $r\geq 3$, $$f(n;r,k)=\max\left(\binom{rk-1}{r}, \binom{n}{r}-\binom{n-k+1}{r}\right).$$

Note: the source states the formula with no range on `n` or `k`, but some restriction
is needed: e.g. for `r = 3`, `k = 2`, `n = 4` no two disjoint triples fit in `4`
vertices, so the left-hand side is `4.choose 3 = 4` while the right-hand side is
`5.choose 3 = 10`. We require `k ≥ 1` and `n ≥ r*k - 1`: this is the smallest `n`
accommodating the construction counted by the first term (all `r`-subsets of a fixed
`(r*k - 1)`-set), and at `n = r*k - 1` the equality holds trivially, since the complete
`r`-uniform hypergraph has no `k`-matching. The source's commentary likewise calls the
case `n < k*r` trivial.
