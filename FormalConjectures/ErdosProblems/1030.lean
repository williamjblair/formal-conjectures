/--
Let $R(k,l)$ be the usual Ramsey number: the smallest $n$ such that if the edges of $K_n$ are
coloured red and blue then there exists either a red $K_k$ or a blue $K_l$.

Prove the existence of some $c>0$ such that
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\frac{R(k+1,k)}{R(k,k)}> 1+c.$$

A problem of Erdős and Sós.
