Is $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n - 3}$ irrational?

The answer is **yes**, proved by P. B. Borwein [Bo91] (with a cleaner self-contained proof in [Bo92]),
specialized to $q = 2$, $r = -3$.

A formal Lean proof is given in an external repository,
[`gotrevor/lean-gallery`](https://github.com/gotrevor/lean-gallery), formalized by Trevor Morris with
Claude Code and Harmonic's Aristotle.

/-- **Erdős Problem 1050.** The series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n - 3}$ is irrational.

The source sum runs over $n \ge 1$; as a `tsum` over `ℕ` (which starts at $0$) it is reindexed
$n \mapsto n + 1$, i.e. $\sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(2^{n+1} - 3)$. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem 1050, variant [Er48].** Erdős proved that the related series
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n - 1}$ (which equals the Lambert series $\sum_n \frac{\tau(n)}{2^n}$,
where $\tau$ is the divisor function) is irrational. This is the $q = 2$, $r = -1$ case of Borwein's
general theorem `Erdos1050.erdos_1050.variants.borwein` below. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem 1050, variant [Bo91].** Borwein's general theorem: for every integer $q \ge 2$
and rational $r \ne 0$ with $r \ne -q^n$ for all $n \ge 1$, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{q^n + r}$
is irrational. Problem 1050 is the case $q = 2$, $r = -3$; the [Er48] variant is $q = 2$, $r = -1$. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem 1050, variant [Er88c] (open).** Erdős conjectured that
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n + t}$ is *transcendental* for every integer $t \ne 0$ — strictly
stronger than the irrationality established by Borwein [Bo91]. This remains open.

Two exclusions make the series well-posed and the claim non-vacuous, exactly as in Borwein's theorem:
$t \ne -2^n$ for all $n \ge 1$ (so no denominator vanishes), and $t \ne 0$ (at $t = 0$ the series is
the rational $\sum_{n \ge 1} 2^{-n} = 1$, hence not transcendental). -/
