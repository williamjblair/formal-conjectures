# Erdős Problem 1055

/-- A prime $p$ is in class $1$ if the only prime divisors of $p+1$ are
$2$ or $3$. In general, a prime $p$ is in class $r$ if every prime factor
of $p+1$ is in some class $\leq r-1$, with equality for at least one prime factor.

The classes partition the primes, so `IsOfClass r p` says that $p$ is in class
*exactly* $r$: the first conjunct of the successor case rules out every class
$\leq r - 1$ for $p$ itself. Without it `IsOfClass 2` would also hold of every
prime of class $1$, because at $r = 2$ the "with equality" clause quantifies over
the single value $m = 1$ and so says nothing. -/

Show that for each $r$ there exists a prime $p$ of class $r$. -/

Are there infinitely many primes in each class?-/

If $p_r$ is the least prime in class $r$, then how does $p_r^{1/r}$ behave?
Erdos conjectured that this tends to infinity. -/
