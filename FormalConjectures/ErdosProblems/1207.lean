`P d n` is the largest number $m$ such that every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has an
isosceles-free subset of size at least $m$.

Let $P_d(n)$ be such that in any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ there exist at least $P_d(n)$ many points which do not contain an isosceles triangle. Estimate $P_d(n)$ - in particular, is it true that $$P_2(n)<n^{1-c}$$ for some constant $c>0$?
