# Erdős Problem 372

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/372](https://www.erdosproblems.com/372)

Conjectured by Erdős and Pomerance. Proved by Balog, who showed the stronger quantitative result
that this holds for $\gg \sqrt{x}$ many $n\leq x$, for all large $x$.

/--
Let $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. There are infinitely many $n$ such that
$P(n)>P(n+1)>P(n+2)$.
