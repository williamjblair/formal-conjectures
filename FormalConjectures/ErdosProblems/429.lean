Is it true that, if $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is sparse enough and does not cover all residue
classes modulo $p$ for any prime $p$, then there exists some $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n+a$ is
prime for all $a\in A$?

Weisenberg [We24] has shown the answer is no: $A$ can be arbitrarily sparse and missing at
least one residue class modulo every prime $p$, and yet $A+n$ is not contained in the primes
for any $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. (Weisenberg gives several constructions of such an $A$.)
