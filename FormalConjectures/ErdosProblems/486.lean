# Erdős Problem 486: Logarithmic density for sets avoiding modular subsets

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/486](https://www.erdosproblems.com/486)

namespace Erdos486

/--
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and for each $n \in A$ choose some
$X_n \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Let
$B = \{m \in \mathbb{N} : m \not\in X_n \pmod{n} \text{ for all } n \in A \text{ with } m > n\}$.
Must $B$ have a logarithmic density?

The set $A$ is encoded by taking $X_n = \emptyset$ for $n \notin A$. Only positive moduli
$n$ are considered, since $\mathbb{Z}/0\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}$ would allow $B$ to be an
arbitrary set.
