The normalised prime gap $\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log n}$, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime.
-/
noncomputable def normalizedGap (n : ℕ) : ℝ := primeGap n / log n

/--
The set $S$ of limit points of $\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log n}$.

Only the *finite* limit points are collected here; that $\infty$ is also a limit point is
Westzynthius' theorem, recorded separately as `erdos_5.variants.westzynthius`.

Erdős' question, as well as [HiMa88] and [Pi16], normalises the prime gaps by $\log n$, whereas
[GPY09], [BFM16] and [Me20] normalise by $\log p_n$. Since $\log p_n/\log n \to 1$ the two
normalisations have the same limit points, so all the results below are stated for the
normalisation used here.

def limitPointSet : Set ℝ := {x : ℝ | MapClusterPt x atTop normalizedGap}

/--
Let $C\geq 0$. Is there an infinite sequence of $n_i$ such that
$$\lim_{i\to \infty}\frac{p_{n_i+1}-p_{n_i}}{\log n_i}=C?$$

We formalise "an infinite sequence of $n_i$" as a strictly monotone sequence of indices
`n : ℕ → ℕ`. Note that the numerator is the gap between the two *consecutive* primes
$p_{n_i}$ and $p_{n_i+1}$, which is `primeGap (n i)`, and not the gap between the primes
indexed by two consecutive members of the sequence.

Let $S$ be the set of limit points of $(p_{n+1}-p_n)/\log n$. This problem asks whether
$S=[0,\infty]$.

Since $\infty\in S$ is known (see `erdos_5.variants.westzynthius`), the open content is the
equality of the finite part of $S$ with $[0,\infty)$.

$\lambda([0,T]\cap S)\geq cT$ for all sufficiently large $T$.

/--
Banks, Freiberg, and Maynard [BFM16] showed that at least $12.5\%$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs
to $S$.

This is [BFM16, Theorem 1.1]: for any nine nonnegative reals
$\beta_1\leq\beta_2\leq\cdots\leq\beta_9$, at least one of the differences $\beta_j-\beta_i$
with $i<j$ belongs to $S$.

  sorry

/--
The $12.5\%$ claim itself, as deduced in [BFM16, Corollary 1.2]:
$\lambda([0,T]\cap S)\geq (1-o(1))T/8$ as $T\to\infty$.

Note that the constant $1/8$ is only attained asymptotically and ineffectively; the bound
[BFM16] obtain for *all* $T>0$ is the weaker $\lambda([0,T]\cap S)>T/22$.

/--
Merikoski [Me20] showed that at least $1/3$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs to $S$.

This is [Me20, Theorem 1]: for any reals $\beta_1\leq\beta_2\leq\beta_3\leq\beta_4$, at least
one of the differences $\beta_j-\beta_i$ with $i<j$ belongs to $S$. Note that, in contrast with
`erdos_5.variants.banks_freiberg_maynard`, the $\beta_i$ are not required to be nonnegative.

  sorry

/--
The $1/3$ claim itself [Me20, Corollary 2]: $\lambda([0,T]\cap S)\geq T/3$ for all $T>0$.

Unlike the $1/8$ of [BFM16], this bound holds uniformly in $T$ with no error term.

/--
Merikoski [Me20] showed that $S$ has bounded gaps.

This is [Me20, Corollary 3]: there is a (ineffective) constant $C\geq 0$ such that
$S\cap[T,T+C]\neq\emptyset$ for all $T\geq 0$.

/--
In [Er65b], [Er85c], and [Er97c] Erdős asks whether $S$ is everywhere dense (but Weisenberg
notes that clearly $S$ is closed so this is equivalent to asking whether $S=[0,\infty]$).

Membership in `limitPointSet` is exactly the existence of an infinite sequence of indices
along which the normalised prime gaps converge, as in the statement of `erdos_5`.

/--
The statement of `erdos_5` is equivalent to the description of the set of limit points in
`erdos_5.variants.limit_point_set`; combine with `mem_limitPointSet_iff` to unfold the
membership into the sequence of indices $n_i$.

    (∀ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C → C ∈ limitPointSet) ↔ limitPointSet = Ici 0 :=
  ⟨fun h => limitPointSet_subset_Ici.antisymm h, fun h _ hC => h ▸ hC⟩

/--
The set $S$ of limit points is closed, as Weisenberg notes in the acknowledgements to
[erdosproblems.com/5](https://www.erdosproblems.com/5); consequently `erdos_5.variants.dense`
and `erdos_5.variants.limit_point_set` ask the same question.
-/
@[category test, AMS 11]
theorem isClosed_limitPointSet : IsClosed limitPointSet := isClosed_setOfPred_clusterPt

/--
Weisenberg's remark, as reported on [erdosproblems.com/5](https://www.erdosproblems.com/5):
since $S$ is closed, asking that $S$ be everywhere dense in $[0,\infty)$ is the same as asking
that $S=[0,\infty)$, so `erdos_5.variants.dense` and `erdos_5.variants.limit_point_set` pose the
same question.
