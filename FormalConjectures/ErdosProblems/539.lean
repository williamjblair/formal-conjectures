# Erdős Problem 539

In this problem, a function $h : \mathbb{N} \to\mathbb{N}$ is defined maximally by a specified
counting property.

The problem asks to estimate $h(n)$. This has been interpreted here as asking for $\Theta(h(n))$.
The principal version includes `answer(sorry)` for an unknown function. On the other hand, the best
known upper bound is $n^{2/3}$ and the best known lower bound is $\sqrt{n}$ so we
also provide these candidates as variants. Moreover, it suffices to show $O(h(n))$ and
$O(\sqrt{n})$ respectively for each, so further variants are provided for those.

In the source paper [Er73], Erdős also remarks that it should not be too difficult
to determine $\lim_{n\to\infty}\log(h(n))/\log(n)$. This does not appear on the website, and
it is not clear whether this remains open, but we include it here either way.
