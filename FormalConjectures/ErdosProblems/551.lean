Prove that
$$R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1$$
for $k\geq n\geq 3$ (except when $n=k=3$).

Asked by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp.
This problem is #18 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.

For sufficiently large $n$ and every $k\geq n$, $R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1$.

Keevash, Long, and Skokan [KLS21] have proved this identity when
$k\geq C\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ for some constant $C$, thus establishing the conjecture
for sufficiently large $n$.
