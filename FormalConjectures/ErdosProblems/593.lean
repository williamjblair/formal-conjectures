**Erdős Problem 593 (\$500)**: Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear
in every 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number $> \aleph_0$.

The answer is the set of obligatory finite 3-uniform hypergraphs, represented here on the
labelled vertex sets `Fin n`.

Two-colorability (Property B) is a necessary condition, see
`erdos_593.variants.obligatory_implies_two_colorable`, but it is not sufficient: two triples
sharing a pair form a 2-colorable hypergraph that is not obligatory, see
`erdos_593.variants.common_pair_not_obligatory`. In the graph case ($r = 2$) the problem is
completely solved by Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal [EGH75]: the obligatory graphs are exactly the finite
bipartite graphs.

A resolution has been claimed by E. Li (arXiv:2606.24882, 2026); at the time of writing
erdosproblems.com still lists the problem as open.

**Necessary direction**: every obligatory finite 3-uniform hypergraph is 2-colorable.

This follows from two constructions in [EGH75]. By [EHR73] (see [EGH75, p. 426]) there are
3-uniform hypergraphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number consisting of edge-disjoint
triples, so an obligatory `F` is linear (no two edges share two vertices). By the remark
preceding [EGH75, Theorem 10.9] there are, for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$, 3-uniform
hypergraphs of chromatic number $> \kappa$ all of whose linear sub-hypergraphs are
2-colorable. An obligatory `F` appears in such a hypergraph, hence is 2-colorable.

**Sufficient direction fails**: it is not the case that every finite 2-colorable 3-uniform
hypergraph is obligatory.

The hypergraph `commonPair` with edges $\{0,1,2\}$ and $\{0,1,3\}$ is 2-colorable but does
not appear in the 3-uniform hypergraphs of large chromatic number consisting of edge-disjoint
triples constructed in [EHR73], see `erdos_593.variants.common_pair_not_obligatory`.

Two triples sharing a pair are **not** obligatory: by [EHR73] (see [EGH75, p. 426]) there are
3-uniform hypergraphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number consisting of edge-disjoint
triples, and `commonPair` does not appear in any of them.

**Graph analogue — bipartite graphs are obligatory (Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal [EGH75])**:
For the 2-uniform (graph) case, a graph of chromatic cardinal $> \aleph_0$ must contain all
finite bipartite graphs. Specifically, for every finite bipartite graph `F` and every graph
`G` with chromatic cardinal $> \aleph_0$, there is a graph embedding from `F` into `G`.

This uses `F ⊑ G` (`SimpleGraph.IsContained`, an injective graph homomorphism), aligned with
the injective edge-preserving map used in the hypergraph `Appears` definition. A graph embedding
`F ↪g G` would require an induced copy, which the theorem does not provide.

/--
**Graph analogue — no odd cycle is obligatory (Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal [EGH75])**:
For every odd $k \geq 3$, there exists a graph with chromatic cardinal $\aleph_1$ that
contains no cycle of length $k$. This shows the class of obligatory graphs is strictly
smaller than all finite graphs.

**Vertices must be uncountable**: Every 3-uniform hypergraph with chromatic cardinal
$> \aleph_0$ must have an uncountable vertex set.

**Proof:** If `V` is countable, there exists an injection `φ : V → ℕ`. Using distinct natural
numbers as colors gives a proper coloring, so $\chi(H) \leq \#\mathbb{N} = \aleph_0$,
contradicting $\chi(H) > \aleph_0$.

**No hyperedges implies chromatic cardinal ≤ 1**: A 3-uniform hypergraph with no edges can
be properly colored with a single color, so its chromatic cardinal is at most 1. In
particular, $\chi(H) > \aleph_0$ implies `H` has at least one hyperedge.

**Monotonicity of the obligatory property**: If `F₁` appears in `F₂` and `F₂` is obligatory,
then `F₁` is also obligatory.

**Proof:** For any `H` with $\chi(H) > \aleph_0$, since `F₂` is obligatory, `F₂` appears
in `H` via some injection `φ₂`. Since `F₁` appears in `F₂` via `φ₁`, the composition
`φ₂ ∘ φ₁` witnesses that `F₁` appears in `H`.

/--
**The empty hypergraph is trivially obligatory**: The 3-uniform hypergraph on `PEmpty` (no
vertices, no edges) appears in every hypergraph via the empty injection.

This degenerate case confirms the definition is well-formed.
