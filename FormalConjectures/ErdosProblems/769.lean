/--
Let $c(n)$ be minimal such that if $k\geq c(n)$ then the $n$-dimensional unit
cube can be decomposed into $k$ homothetic $n$-dimensional cubes. Give good
bounds for $c(n)$ — in particular, is it true that $c(n)\gg n^n$?

The `c(n) \gg n^n` conjecture is **false**: for odd `n`, one can tile the unit
`n`-cube into `k` homothetic cubes for every `k ≥ U(n)` with `U(n)/n^n → 0`, so
`c(n)/n^n → 0` along odd dimensions and no absolute constant lower-bounds it.

Determining good bounds for `c(n)` in general remains open.

  sorry

/--
What refuting $c(n)\gg n^n$ leaves open: give good bounds for $c(n)$. Asked here on the
scale the problem itself sets, $n^n$: does $c$ have a well-defined order
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log c(n)}{n\log n}?$$
The refuted conjecture would have forced this limit to be at least $1$.
The cutoff condition is restricted to positive dimensions: in dimension zero,
exact coverage permits only one tile, so no cutoff exists.
