If $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ has density $0$ then $s^{-1}(A)$ must also have density $0$.

A conjecture of Erdős, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro [EGPS90].

      ∀ A : Set ℕ, A.HasDensity 0 → { x | s x ∈ A }.HasDensity 0 := by
  sorry

/--
It is possible for $s(A)$ to have positive density even if $A$ has zero density (for example
taking $A$ to be the product of two distinct primes).

    ∃ A : Set ℕ, A.HasDensity 0 ∧ (∃ d > 0, (s '' A).HasDensity d) := by

Erdős [Er73b] proved that there are sets $A$ of positive density such that $s^{-1}(A)$ is empty.

Pollack [Po14b] has shown that this is true if $A$ is the set of primes.

factors.

Troupe [Tr20] has also shown this is true if $A$ is the set of integers which are the sum of two
squares.

Pollack, Pomerance, and Thompson [PPT18] prove that if $\epsilon(x)=o(1)$ and $A\subset \mathbb{N}$
has size at most $x^{1/2+\epsilon(x)}$ then $\#\{ n\leq x: s(n)\in A\} =o(x)$ as $x\to \infty$. It
follows that (using $s(n)\ll n\log\log n$) if $A$ grows like
$\lvert A\cap [1,x]\rvert\leq x^{1/2+o(1)}$ then $s^{-1}(A)$ has density $0$.
