/--
Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of size $n$ and let $\{d_1,\ldots,d_k\}$ be
the set of distinct distances determined by $A$. Let $f(d)$ be the number of times
the distance $d$ is determined, ordered so that
$f(d_1)\geq f(d_2)\geq \cdots \geq f(d_k)$. Estimate
$$\max (f(d_1)-f(d_2)),$$
where the maximum is taken over all $A$ of size $n$ (this is `extremalGap n`).

theorem erdos_959 :
    (fun n ↦ (extremalGap n : ℝ)) =Θ[atTop] (answer(sorry) : ℕ → ℝ) := by
  sorry

/--
A superlinear lower bound: there is a $c>0$ with
$$\text{extremalGap}(n)\geq n^{1 + c/\log\log n}$$
for all large $n$, so $\max (f(d_1)-f(d_2))$ grows faster than any linear function
of $n$. Determining the exact order remains open, which is `erdos_959`.
