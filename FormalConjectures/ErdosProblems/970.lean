`IsJacobsthalBound k m` says that every interval of `m` consecutive integers contains an
integer coprime to every positive natural number having at most `k` distinct prime factors.

Let $h(k)$ be Jacobsthal's function, defined to as the minimal $m$ such that, if $n$ has at most $k$ prime factors, then in any set of $m$ consecutive integers there exists an integer coprime to $n$. Determine the order of magnitude of $h(k)$. In particular, is it true that $$h(k) \ll k^2?$$
