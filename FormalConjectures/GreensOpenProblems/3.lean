open Set MeasureTheory

namespace Green3

/-- Suppose that $A \subset [0,1]$ is open and has measure greater than $\frac{1}{3}$. Is there a
solution to $xy = z$ with $x, y, z \in A$?

The answer is yes. [FGY26] prove that an open product-free subset of $(0,1)$ has measure strictly
less than $\frac{1}{3}$. -/

theorem green_3 :
    answer(True) ↔ ∀ A : Set ℝ,
      IsOpen A → A ⊆ Icc 0 1 → volume A > 1/3 →
        ∃ x y z, x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ A ∧ z ∈ A ∧ x * y = z := by
