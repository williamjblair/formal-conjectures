Suppose that $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is partitioned in to sets $A_1, ..., A_K$.
Does $2A_i$ contain a coset of codimension $O_K(1)$ for some $i$?

theorem green_53 :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ (c : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ (n K : ℕ) (A : Fin K → Set (𝔽₂ n)),
      (⋃ i, A i) = Set.univ →
      Pairwise (Disjoint on A) →
      ∃ (i : Fin K) (S : AffineSubspace (ZMod 2) (𝔽₂ n)),
        (S : Set (𝔽₂ n)) ⊆ A i + A i ∧
        n ≤ Module.finrank (ZMod 2) S.direction + c K := by

-- TODO(jgd): Implement variants from Green's comments [Gr24].
