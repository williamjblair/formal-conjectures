/-- A relation on a group is bi-invariant if it is preserved by both left and
right multiplication. -/
def IsBiInvariant (G : Type*) [Group G] (r : G → G → Prop) : Prop :=
  (∀ g a b, r a b → r (g * a) (g * b)) ∧
  (∀ g a b, r a b → r (a * g) (b * g))

/--
`ProOrderable G` means every bi-invariant partial order extends to a
bi-invariant linear order.
-/
def ProOrderable (G : Type*) [Group G] : Prop :=
  ∀ r : G → G → Prop,
    IsPartialOrder G r →
    IsBiInvariant G r →
    ∃ s : G → G → Prop,
      IsLinearOrder G s ∧ IsBiInvariant G s ∧ ∀ x y, r x y → s x y

/--
Do there exist simple pro-orderable groups?
