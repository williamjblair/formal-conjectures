# Expansion of g.f. $(1+x)(3+x)/(1+6x^2+x^4)$

This sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation
$a(n) = -6 a(n-2) - a(n-4)$ for $n \ge 4$,
with initial values $a(0)=3$, $a(1)=4$, $a(2)=-17$, $a(3)=-24$.

/-- The primary defining sequence `a`, which is the expansion of the generating function
$(1+x)(3+x)/(1+6x^2+x^4)$. It satisfies the recurrence $a(n) = -6 a(n-2) - a(n-4)$
for $n \ge 4$. -/

**Conjecture from Creighton Dement (A100434)**:
Let the auxiliary sequences c, d, e, f, g, b be defined as specified.
Then for all $n \ge 0$, $c(n) + d(n) = b(n)$.

**Proof outline**:
strong two-step induction on the paired recurrences. The even/odd cases are coupled
through closed identities between consecutive terms of the relevant pair of sequences
(here $c, d$), and the induction step is discharged by `rfl`-level unfolding of the definitions
plus linear arithmetic. (Numerically verified for $n < 600$ before formalization.)
