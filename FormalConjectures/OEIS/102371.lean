# Conjectures associated with A102371

The sequence $a(n)$ is defined by the recurrence relation $a(1)=1$,
and for $n>1$, $a(n) = a(n-1) \operatorname{XOR} (a(n-1) + n)$.
The conjecture asks if $a(n) = 2^n - 1 - \operatorname{A105033}(n-1)$ for $n \ge 1$.

/-- The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is defined by the recurrence relation $a(1)=1$, and for $n>1$,
$a(n) = a(n-1) \operatorname{XOR} (a(n-1) + n)$,
where $\operatorname{XOR}$ is the bitwise exclusive-or operator (`^^^`). -/

  anMinus1 ^^^ (anMinus1 + (n' + 2))

Do we have $a(n) = 2^n - 1 - \operatorname{A105033}(n-1)$ for $n \ge 1$?

Note: The OEIS comment suggests $n-1$ which means this applies at least for $n \ge 1$,
as we assume $\operatorname{A105033}(\mathbb{N})$ is defined on $\mathbb{N}$.
We include the case $n=1$ which relies on $A105033(0)$, which is 0.
