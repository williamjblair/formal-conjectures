# Smallest power with base>1 and exponent $n$ without digit 0

For statistical reasons it is conjectured that the sequence is finite.
Also it is conjectured that $a(40)$ does not exist (i.e. the sequence is empty for $n=40$).

A helper predicate: $b^n$ is a power with base $>1$ whose decimal representation
does not contain the digit 0.
We assume $n$ is the exponent, $n \ge 1$.

/--
The primary defining sequence `a`.
`a n` is the smallest power with base $>1$ and exponent $n$ whose decimal representation
doesn't contain the digit 0.
$$a(n) = (\min \{ b \in \mathbb{N} \mid b > 1,
  \text{decimal representation of } b^n \text{ contains no digit } 0 \})^n$$
If no such base exists, `sInf` of an empty set of naturals returns 0, so `a n = 0`.

/--
For statistical reasons it is conjectured that the sequence is finite.
Finite means here that for some $n$, no power $b^n$ with base $b > 1$ has a zeroless decimal
representation, which in our definition results in $a(n) = 0$.

$a(40)$, if it exists, is not known.

This claim is rooted in the finiteness conjecture. The most direct mathematical expression
of the open problem concerning $a(40)$ is the negation of the existence of a valid base.
