# $a(n) = [x^{2n}] \left(\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}\right)^n$

The sequence is given by the combinatorial identity:
$a(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{2n+k-1}{n-1}$
with $a(0) = 1$.

The recurrence given below can be rewritten in the form
$$(2n+1)(2n+2)P(2,n)a(n+1) - (2n-1)(2n-2)P(2,-n)a(n-1) = Q(2,n^2)a(n),$$
where the polynomial $Q(2,n) = 4(55n^2 - 34n + 3)$ and the polynomial $P(2,n) = 5n^2 - 5n + 1$
satisfies the symmetry condition $P(2,n) = P(2,1-n)$ and has real zeros.
More generally, for fixed $m = 1,2,3, \ldots$, we conjecture that the sequence $b(n) := a(mn)$
satisfies a recurrence of the form
$$( \prod_{k = 1}^{2m} (2mn + k) )P(2m,n)b(n+1) + (-1)^m( \prod_{k = 1}^{2*m} (2mn - k) )
  P(2m,-n)b(n-1) = Q(2m,n^2)b(n),$$
where the polynomials $P(2m,n)$ and $Q(2m,n)$ have degree $2m$. Conjecturally, the polynomial
$P(2m,n) = P(2m,1-n)$ and has real zeros in the interval [0, 1].
The $4m$ zeros of the polynomial $Q(2m,n^2)$ seem to belong to the interval $[-1, 1]$ and
$4m - 2$ of these zeros appear to be approximated by the rational numbers
$\pm k/(3m)$, where $1 \le k \le 3m - 2$, $k$ not a multiple of $3$.
