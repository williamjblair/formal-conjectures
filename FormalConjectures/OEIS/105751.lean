The primary defining sequence `a`.
a n is the imaginary part of $\prod_{k=0}^n (1 + k \cdot i)$, where $i = \sqrt{-1}$.

Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division holds in this case.
Type 1: primes p that do not divide any element of the sequence {$a(n)$}.
In this case, unlike in A105750, the set of type 1 primes is empty;
that is, every prime p divides some term of this sequence.

Note: The triangular number n*(n+1)/2 divides $a(n)$ (see A164652).
In particular, if $p$ is an odd prime then $p$ divides $a(p)$. For $p=2$, $2$ divides $a(4)=-40$.

Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence and takes the form:
(i) the $2$-adic valuation $\nu_2(a(n)) \sim n/4$ as n -> oo.

Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence and takes the form:
(ii) for the other primes of type $2$, the p-adic valuation
$\nu_p(a(n)) \sim n/(p - 1)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

(Type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1 (mod 4))
