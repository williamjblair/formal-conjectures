# Fibonacci-Collatz sequence

Fibonacci-Collatz sequence: $a(1)=1, a(2)=2$; for $n > 2$, let $\mathrm{fib} = a(n-1) + a(n-2)$;
if $\mathrm{fib}$ is odd then $a(n) = 3 \cdot \mathrm{fib} + 1$ else $a(n) = \mathrm{fib}/2$.

/-- The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the Fibonacci-Collatz sequence: $a(1)=1, a(2)=2$; for $n > 2$,
let $\mathrm{fib} = a(n-1) + a(n-2)$;
if $\mathrm{fib}$ is odd then $a(n) = 3 \cdot \mathrm{fib} + 1$ else $a(n) = \mathrm{fib}/2$. -/
def a : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 0 -- The sequence is 1-indexed, a(0) is a conventional filler.
  | 1 => 1
  | 2 => 2
  | n + 3 =>
    let fib := a (n + 2) + a (n + 1)
    if fib % 2 = 1 then 3 * fib + 1 else fib / 2

Conjecture: for every $k > 0$ there is an index $m$ such that all the $a(n)$ with $n > m$
have the same residue $\bmod 3^k$.
