# A108306: Expansion of $(3x+1)/(1-3x-3x^2)$

This sequence satisfies the linear recurrence relation $a(0)=1$, $a(1)=6$,
and $a(n) = 3a(n-1) + 3a(n-2)$ for $n \ge 2$.

/-- The primary defining sequence `a`.
`a n` is the $n$-th term of the expansion of $(3x+1)/(1-3x-3x^2)$,
satisfying $a(0)=1, a(1)=6, a(n)=3a(n-1)+3a(n-2)$. -/

The sequence is the INVERT transform of (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, ...) and can be obtained
by extracting the upper left terms of matrix powers of [(1,5); (1,2)].
These results are a case (a=5, b=2) of the general conjecture below.

The conjecture: The INVERT transform of a sequence starting
$(1, a, ab, ab^2, ab^3, \ldots)$ is equivalent to extracting the upper left terms
of powers of the 2x2 matrix [(1,a); (1,b)].
