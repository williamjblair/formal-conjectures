# Smallest $m > 0$ such that there are no primes between $nm$ and $n(m+1)$ inclusive.

Sierpinski's conjecture (1958) is precisely that a(n) >= n for all n.

The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the smallest $m > 0$ such that there are no primes between $n \cdot m$
and $n \cdot (m+1)$ inclusive.
