# Integer part of $\mathrm{prime}(n)/\pi(n)$

Here $\mathrm{prime}(n)$ is the $n$-th prime number, and $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function.

`a n` is the integer part of $\mathrm{prime}(n)/\pi(n)$.
Here $\mathrm{prime}(n)$ is the $n$-th prime number, and $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function.
The sequence is defined for $n \ge 2$.

$a(n)$ is greater than $a(n+1)$.
