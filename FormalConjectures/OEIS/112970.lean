# A generalized Stern sequence

A112970: A generalized Stern sequence, defined by the recurrence relations:
$a(2n+1) = a(n)$ and $a(2n) = a(n) + a(n-2)$ with $a(0)=1$, $a(1)=1$ and $a(n)=0$ for $n \le -1$.

a n is the generalized Stern sequence, defined by the recurrence relations:
$a(2n+1) = a(n)$ and $a(2n) = a(n)$ + $a(n-2)$ with $a(0) = 1$, $a(1) = 1$
and $a(n) = 0$ for $n \le -1$.

Conjectures: a(2^n)=a(2^(n+1)+1)=A033638(n).
This formalizes the equality a(2^n) = a(2^(n+1)+1).
