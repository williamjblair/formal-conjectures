# Expansion of g.f. $-(1 - 48x^2 - 256x^3) / ((1 - 4x)(1 + 4x)(1 + 4x + 16x^2))$

Corresponds to m = 4 in a family of 4th-order linear recurrence sequences

This sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation with signature $(-4, 0, 64, 256)$
and initial values $a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 64$.
The recurrence is $a(n) = -4 a(n-1) + 64 a(n-3) + 256 a(n-4)$.

Conjecture: $a(m, 2n+1)$ is a perfect square for all $m$ (see A113249).
Specialized to $m = 4$, which is A113250.
