# Conjectures associated with A113252

Corresponds to m = 6 in a family of 4th order linear recurrence sequences

This sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation
a(n) = -4 a(n-1) + 144 a(n-3) + 1296 a(n-4) for n > 3.
Initial values are a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 92, a(3) = 784.

a n is the sequence defined by the linear recurrence
$a(n) = -4 a(n-1) + 144 a(n-3) + 1296 a(n-4)$ with initial values $-1, 4, 92, 784$.

Conjecture: $a(m, 2n+1)$ is a perfect square for all $m, n$ (see A113249).
Specialized for $m=6$, which is A113252.
