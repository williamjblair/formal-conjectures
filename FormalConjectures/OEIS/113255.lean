# Conjectures associated with A113255

Corresponds to m = 9 in a family of 4th-order linear recurrence sequences

This sequence is defined by the recurrence relation
$a(n) = -4 a(n-1) + 324 a(n-3) + 6561 a(n-4)$ for n > 3.
Initial values are $a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 227, a(3) = 5329$.

a n is the sequence defined by the linear recurrence
$a(n) = -4 a(n-1) + 324 a(n-3) + 6561 a(n-4)$ with initial values $-1, 4, 227, 5329$.

Conjecture: $a(m, 2n+1)$ is a perfect square for all $m, n$ (see A113249).
Specialized for $m=9$, which is A113255.
