Conjecture based on OEIS A114831: What is this sequence, asymptotically?
If the limit exists, the ratio of consecutive terms must tend to $\sqrt{3}$:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)} = \sqrt{3}. $$
That's because $a(n)$ is positive, monotonically increasing ($a(n) > a(n-1)$)
and $a(n+2) \geq a(n+1) + a(n)$.
So $a(n)$ grows exponentially, at least as fast as the Fibonnaci numbers.
Assuming $\frac{a(n+1)}{a(n)}$ tend to a limit L, solving for L in the definition of $a(n)$
gives $L=\sqrt{3}$.
