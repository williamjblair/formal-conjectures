# Collatz step differences

Differences in adjacent elements of the sequence quantifying the steps needed for $n$ to
converge to 1 in the Collatz Conjecture.
$$a(n) = \mathrm{A006577}(n+1) - \mathrm{A006577}(n)$$
for $n > 0$.

Conjecture 2: 1, 6 and 16 appear only once and 3 appears twice in the sequence,

Conjecture 3 (Ya-Ping Lu, 2024):
Except 1, 3 and 6, the absolute value of all terms can be written as $5x + 8y$ for $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.
(Note: in the OEIS comment, "x and y are integers" means $x$ and $y$ have the same sign,
i.e., $|v| = 5x + 8y$ with $x, y \ge 0$, since every integer is a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of 5 and 8).

Conjecture 4 (Ya-Ping Lu, 2024):
The ratio of the number of terms with value $m$ to that of $-m$ approaches 1 as $n \to \infty$,
