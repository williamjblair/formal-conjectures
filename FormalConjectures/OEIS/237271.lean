# Number of parts in the symmetric representation of $\sigma(n)$

Number of parts in the symmetric representation of $\sigma(n)$. $a(n)$ is $1$ plus the number of pairs $(d_k, d_{k+1})$ of consecutive divisors of $n$
such that $d_{k+1}$ is odd and $d_{k+1} \ge 2 d_k$.

The formula used is
$1 + |\{(d_k, d_{k+1}) \in \text{consecutive pairs of divisors of } n \mid
d_{k+1} \text{ is odd and } d_{k+1} \ge 2 d_k\}|$,
which is a known characterization of the sequence.

Number of maximal contiguous sublists of divisors of n where each adjacent pair (d_k, d_{k+1})

Conjecture 2: "a(n) is the number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of n.
We call '2-dense sublists of divisors of n' to the maximal sublists of divisors of n whose terms
increase by a factor of at most 2." - _Omar E. Pol_, Jul 31 2025

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).

Conjecture 3: "a(n) is the number of divisors p of n such that p is greater than
twice the adjacent previous divisor of n. The divisors p give the n-th row of A379288."
- _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 02 2025

Note: this is equivalent to `a_eq_num2DenseSublists` (Conjecture 2), since the divisors that
start a new 2-dense sublist are exactly those greater than twice their predecessor (plus the
smallest divisor).

Observation: "a(A002997(n)) >= 3, at least for 1 <= n <= 10000."
- _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 21 2025

That is, $a(k) \ge 3$ for every Carmichael number $k$.
A002997 is the sequence of Carmichael numbers: the composite numbers $k$ such that
$b^{k-1} \equiv 1 \pmod k$ for every $b$ coprime to $k$. This is `IsCarmichael`,
which also forces $k$ to be composite.
