# Asymptotics of an inner sum formula for $a(n)$

The inner sum of the formula used in a:
$$\sum_{\max(k-n+5, 0) \le j \le \min(k,4)} \binom{8-j}{j}\binom{2n-k+j-10}{k-j}$$

a: A total of $n$ married couples, including a mathematician M and his wife, are to be seated
at the $2n$ chairs around a circular table, with no man seated next to his wife. After the ladies
are seated at every other chair, M is the first man allowed to choose one of the remaining chairs.
The sequence gives the number of ways of seating the other men, with no man seated next to his
wife, if M chooses the chair that is 9 seats clockwise from his wife's chair.

$$a(n) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } n \le 5 \cr
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^k(n-k-1)! \sum_{\max(k-n+5, 0) \le j \le \min(k,4)}
\binom{8-j}{j}\binom{2n-k+j-10}{k-j} & \text{if } n > 5 \end{cases}$$
