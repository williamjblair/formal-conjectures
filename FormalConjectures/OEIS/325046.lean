# Pronic indices for odd coefficients of $\sum_{n \ge 0} x^n \frac{(1+x^n)^n}{(1-x^{n+1})^{n+1}}$

Coefficients of G.f. $\sum_{n \ge 0} x^n \cdot \frac{(1 + x^n)^n}{(1 - x^{n+1})^{n+1}}$.

The term $a(N)$ is the coefficient of $x^N$ in the generating function.
Expanding the terms, we get a formula for $a(N)$:
$$a(N) = \sum_{n=0}^N \sum_{k=0}^n \mathbf{1}_{n + nk + (n+1)j = N} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+j}{j}$$
where $j = \frac{N - n(k+1)}{n+1}$.

Conjecture: Odd terms occur only at positions $n(n+1)$ for $n \ge 0$.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).

This statement is equivalent to `OeisA323557.odd_a_implies_pronic`. The two sequences differ
only by the sign $(-1)^j$ on each summand, so they agree modulo $2$ and have the same odd
indices.
