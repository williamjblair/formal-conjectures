# Periodicity of $k$-th prime factors in coupled nonlinear recurrence $a(n)$

The sequence $a(n)$ is defined by $a(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) + a(n-2)b(n-1)$
where $b(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) - a(n-2)b(n-1)$, with $a(0) = b(0) = b(1) = 1$ and $a(1) = 2$.

The sequence defined by the mutual recurrence relations:
$a(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) + a(n-2)b(n-1)$ and $b(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) - a(n-2)b(n-1)$
starting with $a(0) = b(0) = b(1) = 1$ and $a(1) = 2$.
The terms are in $\mathbb{Z}$ due to negative values.

/--
The $k$-th smallest distinct prime factor of an integer $n$ (where $k \ge 1$).
This is defined as the $k$-th element (0-indexed $k-1$) of the increasing list of
distinct prime factors of `n.natAbs`.
Returns 1 if n has fewer than k distinct prime factors or if n is 0, 1, or -1,
following the informal convention.

Conjecture: For any $k > 1$, if you take the $k$-th prime factor of each term, you get an
eventually periodic sequence. - _Bryle Morga_, Mar 31 2025

Here the $k$-th prime factor of $a(n)$ is the $k$-th smallest distinct prime divisor of
$|a(n)|$; for example the second prime factors of $a(5) = 18$, $a(6) = 20$ and $a(7) = 896$
are $3$, $5$ and $7$.

This was proved by Terence Tao in a [MathOverflow answer](https://mathoverflow.net/a/490348),
using that $a(n)$ divides $a(n+3)$ for all $n$.
