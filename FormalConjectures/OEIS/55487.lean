Conjecture: unless $n! + 1$ is prime (i.e., $n \in \text{A002981}$), $a(n) = p q$ where $p$ is the
least prime $> \sqrt{n!}$ such that $(p - 1) \mid n!$ and $q = \frac{n!}{p - 1} + 1$ is prime.
- M. F. Hasler, Oct 04 2009

We assume $a(n) \ne 0$ and $(p(n)).\text{Prime}$ to ensure the `sInf` searches are non-empty
and do not collapse to $0 = 0$.
