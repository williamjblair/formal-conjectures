# Number of times $n^2 + s^2$ is prime for positive integers $s < n$

The sequence $a(n)$ counts the number of integers $s \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$ such that
$n^2 + s^2$ is prime:
$$a(n) = \sum_{s=1}^{n-1} [\text{Prime}(n^2 + s^2)]$$

Stronger conjecture: Let $\pi(n)$ be the prime counting function (A000720).
Then $\pi(n) \ge a(n) \ge \pi(n)/5$ for $n > 1$, with the following equalities:
$\pi(2) = a(2)$, $\pi(10) = a(10)$ and $a(12) = \pi(12)/5$.

This conjunction is false: its upper bound $\pi(n) \ge a(n)$ fails at
$n = 512720 = 2^4 \cdot 5 \cdot 13 \cdot 17 \cdot 29$, where $a(n) = 42666$ and
$\pi(n) = 42493$. The OEIS entry tabulates $a$ only up to $n = 10^4$. The lower bound and the
three equalities are unaffected; see `conjecture2.variants.without_upper_bound`.-/

The upper bound of the stronger conjecture on its own. It is false: $a(512720) = 42666$ while
