# The Rule 30 Prize Problems

**Rule 30** is the elementary cellular automaton with local update $c' = l \oplus (c \lor r)$,
the Boolean rule numbered $30$ by Wolfram. Started from a single black cell on a bi-infinite row,
its **center column** `t ↦ (state t) 0` looks random — it was long *Mathematica*'s default
pseudorandom generator — yet nothing about that randomness is proven. In 2019 Wolfram offered
the **Rule 30 Prizes** for three questions about it; we formalize the first two.

* **Problem 1.** Is the center column non-periodic (never eventually periodic)?
* **Problem 2.** Does each color occur on average equally often, i.e. does the running average
  of the values converge to $1/2$?

Problem 3 — whether computing the $n$-th cell requires at least $O(n)$ work — is omitted. It is
model-relative and has no canonical model-independent phrasing. All three are open.

/-- The Rule 30 local update on a bi-infinite row `row : ℤ → Bool`.
The new value at position $i$ is `row (i-1) ⊕ (row i ∨ row (i+1))`, i.e. Wolfram's rule $30$. -/
def step (row : ℤ → Bool) : ℤ → Bool :=
  fun i => xor (row (i - 1)) (row i || row (i + 1))

/-- The Rule 30 evolution from the single-black-cell initial condition: `state 0` is black
exactly at position $0$, and each subsequent row is obtained by applying `step`. -/

theorem state_succ (t : ℕ) : state (t + 1) = step (state t) := rfl

/-- The **center column** of Rule 30: the value of the single central cell (position $0$)
at time $t$. -/
def centerColumn (t : ℕ) : Bool := state t 0

/-- Sanity check: the first center-column values reproduce the known Rule 30 center column
([OEIS A051023](https://oeis.org/A051023)). Unlike `state_zero`/`state_succ`, this exercises the
composed evolution, guarding against a wrong seed, a swapped `xor`/`||`, or an off-by-one
neighbour index. -/

/-- **Rule 30 Prize, Problem 1 (non-periodicity).** The center column of Rule 30 is not
eventually periodic: there is no positive period $p$ and threshold $N$ past which the column
repeats with period $p$. -/

/-- **Rule 30 Prize, Problem 2 (equal frequency).** Each color occurs on average equally often
in the center column: the set of times at which it is black has natural density $1/2$. This is
Wolfram's phrasing that the discrete limit of $\mathrm{Total}[c[t]]/t$ as $t \to \infty$ is
$1/2$. -/
