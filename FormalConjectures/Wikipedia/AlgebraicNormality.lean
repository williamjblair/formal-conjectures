# Normality of Irrational Algebraic Numbers

It is unknown whether every irrational algebraic real number is normal in any integer base.
Here a real number is *normal in base* $b$ if, for every $k \ge 1$, every string of $k$ digits
appears in its base-$b$ expansion with asymptotic frequency $1/b^k$.
The stronger conjecture that every irrational algebraic real number is absolutely normal is stated
separately: normality in one base and normality in every base are not equivalent definitions.
