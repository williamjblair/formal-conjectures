Let $G$ be a finitely generated group, and assume there exists $n$ such that for every $g$ in $G$,
$g^n = 1$. Must $G$ be finite?

The answer is negative. Novikov and Adian proved that for every odd $n > 4381$ there exist
infinite, finitely generated groups of exponent $n$ [NA68]; Adian later reduced this to odd
$n > 665$ [Ad79]. The even case is harder: Ivanov proved $B(m, n)$ infinite for $m > 1$ and
even $n \ge 2^{48}$ divisible by $2^9$ [Iv94], and Lysënok improved this to $m > 1$ and
$n \ge 8000$ [Ly96]. Any such group, for example the free Burnside group $B(2, 667)$,
refutes the statement below.

Note this concerns only the universally quantified question stated here, which a single
counterexample closes. The classification of which free Burnside groups $B(m, n)$ are finite
remains open, with $B(2, 5)$ the best known open case.
