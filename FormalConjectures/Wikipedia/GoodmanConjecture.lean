# Goodman's conjecture on coefficients of $p$-valent functions

A regular (analytic) function is **$p$-valent** on the unit disk if it assumes each value at most
$p$ times there, and some value exactly $p$ times. For such a function $f(z) = \sum_{n \ge 1} b_n z^n$
(so $f(0) = 0$), **Goodman's conjecture** (1948) asserts that its coefficients satisfy
$$|b_n| \le \sum_{k=1}^{p} \frac{2k (n+p)!}{(p-k)!\,(p+k)!\,(n-p-1)!\,(n^2-k^2)} |b_k|
\qquad (n > p).$$
This generalises the classical coefficient bounds for univalent functions (the case $p = 1$,
where the bound reads $|b_n| \le n\,|b_1|$, i.e. $|b_n| \le n$ under the classical normalisation
$b_1 = 1$) to $p$-valent functions. It has been verified in several special cases, including
$p$-valent typically-real functions.

/-- A function `f : ℂ → ℂ` is **$p$-valent** on the open unit disk $\mathbb{D} = \{z : |z| < 1\}$
if it is analytic there, attains every value at most $p$ times, and attains some value exactly
$p$ times. Here $p \ge 1$.
Values are counted at distinct points. For a non-constant analytic function this agrees with
counting with multiplicity: near a point where $f - w$ has a zero of order $m$, every value close
to $w$ is attained at $m$ distinct points, so the maximal number of distinct preimages equals the
maximal number of preimages counted with multiplicity. -/

**Goodman's conjecture.** For every $p$-valent normalised function $f$ on the unit disk and every
$n > p$, the $n$-th coefficient is bounded by the Goodman bound:
$$|b_n| \le \sum_{k=1}^{p} \frac{2k (n+p)!}{(p-k)!\,(p+k)!\,(n-p-1)!\,(n^2-k^2)} |b_k|.$$

/--
Sanity check: in the univalent case $p = 1$, the Goodman bound reduces to the classical
Bieberbach-type bound $|b_n| \le n\,|b_1|$. Concretely the single $k = 1$ summand is
$$\frac{2 (n+1)!}{0!\,2!\,(n-2)!\,(n^2-1)} = \frac{(n+1)!}{(n-2)!\,(n^2-1)} = n,$$
so the bound equals $n\,|b_1|$.
