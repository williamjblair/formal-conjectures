# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 100

**Verbatim statement (WOWII #100, status O):**
> If G is a simple connected graph, then α(G) ≤ CEIL[(maximum of λ(v) + 0.5*length(Ḡ))/2]

**Source:** http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/all.html#conj100

The WOWII HTML uses `length(Ḡ)` (the bar denotes graph complement); the
extracted JSON in our private repo previously dropped the overline. The
formal statement below uses the Euclidean norm of the degree sequence of `Gᶜ`.

## Definition of graph length

The WOWII definitions popup defines `length(H)` as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the vertex degrees. This is `degreeL2Norm H` in Lean.
Combined with the overline above, the inequality reads:
  `α(G) ≤ ⌈(max_v l(v) + 0.5 · degreeL2Norm(Gᶜ)) / 2⌉`
where `l(v) = indepNeighbors G v`.

WOWII [Conjecture 100](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/all.html#conj100)
(status O):

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`α(G) ≤ ⌈(max_v l(v) + 0.5 · degreeL2Norm(Gᶜ)) / 2⌉`
where `α(G) = G.indepNum` is the independence number,
`max_v l(v)` is the maximum over all vertices of the independence number of
the neighbourhood (in `G`), and `degreeL2Norm(Gᶜ)` is the square root of the
sum of the squares of the degrees in the complement `Gᶜ`.
