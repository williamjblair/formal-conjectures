# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 146

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

The **square** of a graph $G$, denoted $G^2$, is the graph on the same vertex set
where two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance in $G$ is at
most $2$.

The **radius of $G^2$** is the minimum eccentricity of any vertex in $G^2$, i.e.,
$$\mathrm{rad}(G^2) = \min_{v \in V} \max_{u \in V} \mathrm{dist}_{G^2}(u, v).$$

WOWII [Conjecture 146](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{tree}(G) \ge 2 \cdot \mathrm{ecc}(B) / \mathrm{rad}(G^2)$
where $\mathrm{tree}(G)$ is the number of vertices in a largest induced subtree,
$\mathrm{ecc}(B)$ is the eccentricity of the boundary vertices of $G$ (`eccSet`
and `maxEccentricityVertices`), and $\mathrm{rad}(G^2)$ is the radius of the square
graph of $G$.

We state the inequality in the form
$\mathrm{tree}(G) \cdot \mathrm{rad}(G^2) \ge 2 \cdot \mathrm{ecc}(B)$ to avoid division.

## Informal proof

Write $t$ for the largest induced-tree order, $r$ and $d$ for the radius and
diameter of $G$, and $p$ for the eccentricity of its peripheral set.  First,
the distance in the graph square is
$\operatorname{dist}_{G^2}(u,v)=\lceil\operatorname{dist}_G(u,v)/2\rceil$,
so $\operatorname{rad}(G^2)=\lceil r/2\rceil$.  A diametral geodesic is an
induced path, giving $t\ge d+1$, while $p\le d-1$.  These bounds settle every
case except $r=2$, $d=4$, and $p=3$.  In that remaining configuration, choose
a centre and shortest paths to two diametral vertices and to a vertex at
distance three from the peripheral set.  A finite case analysis on the two
possible cross-arm edges (and then the possible chords) always produces an
induced tree on at least six vertices.  Hence $t\,\operatorname{rad}(G^2)
\ge 2p$ in the exceptional case as well.
