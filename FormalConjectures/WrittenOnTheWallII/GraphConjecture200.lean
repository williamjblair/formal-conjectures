# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 200

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Counterexample

For every integer $q \geq 5$, let $C = \{a,b\} \cup D$ have $q$ vertices and
induce $K_q$ minus the edge $ab$. Add two nonadjacent vertices $x,y$, each
complete to $C$; a vertex $z$ adjacent exactly to $a,b$; and, for every
$d \in D$, a pendant vertex $p_d$ adjacent exactly to $d$.

The local-neighbourhood independence numbers are $2$ at $x,y,z$, $1$ at each
$p_d$, and $3$ at every vertex of $C$. Their sum is $4q+4$, while the graph has
$2q+1$ vertices, so
$$\left\lceil 1 + l_{\mathrm{avg}}(G)\right\rceil = 4.$$
The vertices $\{a,x,y,z\}$ induce a claw, and a case split on the number of
vertices from $C$ shows that no induced tree has more than four vertices.
Thus $\operatorname{tree}(G)=4$. Finally, the graph has $q-2 \geq 3$ pendant
vertices, but a Hamiltonian path has only two endpoints.

The smallest member of this family has 11 vertices and graph6 encoding
`J??FFBRq}N_`.
This is a smallest counterexample overall: an exhaustive search over all
11,989,760 connected graphs on 4 ≤ n ≤ 10 vertices (via nauty's `geng`;
graphs on at most 3 vertices are trivially traceable) found no graph
satisfying the premise without a Hamiltonian path.

WOWII [Conjecture 200](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`, if `tree(G) = ⌈1 + l_avg(G)⌉`, then `G` has a Hamiltonian path.
Here `tree(G)` is the number of vertices of a largest induced tree subgraph, and
`l_avg(G) = averageIndepNeighbors G` is the average over all vertices of the independence number
of the neighbourhood.
A Hamiltonian path is a walk visiting every vertex exactly once.

This conjecture is false. The counterexample family in the module docstring
satisfies the equality hypothesis and has no Hamiltonian path.
