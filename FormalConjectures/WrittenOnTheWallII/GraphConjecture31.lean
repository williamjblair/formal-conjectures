# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 31

The WOWII page records this as **Chung's theorem**. This radius bound is proved
in Section 2 of P. Erdős, M. Saks, and V. T. Sós, *Maximum Induced Trees in
Graphs*, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B **41** (1986), 61–79; the authors credit
Fan Chung for the proof. We state it here as a theorem; the formal proof is left
as `sorry` pending a Lean port of the argument.

Here $\mathrm{path}(G)$ is the maximum number of vertices in an induced path,
and $\mathrm{rad}(G)$ is the graph radius.

(Chung):

For every simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{path}(G) \ge 2 \cdot \mathrm{rad}(G) - 1$,
where $\mathrm{path}(G)$ is the maximum number of vertices in an induced path
and $\mathrm{rad}(G)$ is the graph radius.
