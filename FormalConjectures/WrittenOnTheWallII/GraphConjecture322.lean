# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 322

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaViña, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

The source applies the local-independence hypothesis to the complement graph. Its conclusion
also follows from the characterization of minimal total dominating sets of complete multipartite
graphs in [M. Subramanian and A. Selvakumar, *Total Domination and Minimal Total Domination
Polynomial of H-Join Graphs*](https://doi.org/10.2298/FIL2501267S).

WOWII [Conjecture 322](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/open.html)

Let `G` be a simple connected graph on `n ≥ 5` vertices. If the maximum over all
vertices `v` of `l(v)` in the complement graph `Gᶜ` — the independence number of
the neighborhood `N(v)` of `v` — is at most 1, then `G` is well totally dominated.

Here `l(v) = α(Gᶜ[N(v)])` is the independence number of the subgraph induced by the
open neighborhood of `v` in `Gᶜ`.

This proof was provided by Samuel Schlesinger.
