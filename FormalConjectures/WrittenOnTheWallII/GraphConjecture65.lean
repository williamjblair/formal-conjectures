# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 65

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Counterexample

The conjecture is false. Start with the path $v_0-v_1-\cdots-v_{12}$ and attach one
triangle at $v_1$ and another at $v_{11}$. The resulting graph has $17$ vertices.
Its Graph_6 string is `PhCGGC@?G?_@?@O?G?G?G?@C`.
Its only minimum-degree vertices are $v_0$ and $v_{12}$, at distance $12$, while its
only maximum-degree vertices are $v_1$ and $v_{11}$, at distance $10$. Thus the
conjectured lower bound is $12 + \lceil 10/3 \rceil = 16$.

Every induced forest must omit at least one vertex from each of the two vertex-disjoint
triangles, so it has at most $15$ vertices. Conversely, deleting one non-path vertex
from each triangle leaves a tree on $15$ vertices.

WOWII [Conjecture 65](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/):

Does every simple connected graph $G$ satisfy
$f(G) \ge \operatorname{dist\_min}(A) + \lceil \operatorname{dist\_min}(M) / 3 \rceil$,
where $A$ is the set of minimum-degree vertices, $M$ is the set of maximum-degree vertices,
and $\operatorname{dist\_min}(S)$ is the minimum distance between two distinct vertices of $S$
(see `distMin`).

The answer is no. `Counterexample.graph` has a conjectured lower bound of $16$, but every
induced forest in it has at most $15$ vertices.
