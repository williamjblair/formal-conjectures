This file introduces some common assumptions made on polynomials in certain conjectures.
Note that the terminology is non-standard.

/--
**Bunyakovsky condition**
A condition on polynomials in the Schinzel and Bunyakovsky conjectures.
Holds for nonconstant irreducible polynomial with positive leading coefficient.
-/
def BunyakovskyCondition (f : ℤ[X]) : Prop :=
  1 ≤ f.degree ∧ Irreducible f ∧ 0 < f.leadingCoeff

/--
**Schinzel condition**
A condition on sets of polynomials in the Schinzel and Bunyakovsky conjectures.
Holds if for every prime $p$ there exists a natural $n$ such that for every polynomial $f$ in the set, $p$ does not divide $f(n)$.
-/
def SchinzelCondition (fs : Finset ℤ[X]) : Prop :=
  ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → ∃ n : ℕ, ∀ f ∈ fs, ¬(p : ℤ) ∣ f.eval (n : ℤ)
