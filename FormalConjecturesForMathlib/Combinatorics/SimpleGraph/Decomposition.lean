# Edge decompositions of simple graphs

`SimpleGraph.IsDecomposition G D` says that the finite family `D` of subgraphs of `G`
partitions the edge set of `G`. Used by Erdős Problems 184 and 583.

/--
`D` is a decomposition of `G` into edge-disjoint subgraphs: the edge sets of the members of `D`
are pairwise disjoint and their union is the edge set of `G`.
