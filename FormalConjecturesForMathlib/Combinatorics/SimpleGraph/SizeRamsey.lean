# Size Ramsey Number

This file defines the size Ramsey number for simple graphs.

## Definition

The size Ramsey number `r̂(G, H)` is the minimum number of edges in a graph `F`
such that any 2-coloring of `F`'s edges contains a copy of `G` in one color or `H` in the other.

The size Ramsey number `r̂(G, H)` is the minimum number of edges in a graph `F`
such that any 2-coloring of `F`'s edges contains a copy of `G` in one color or `H` in the other.

A 2-coloring is represented by a subgraph `R ≤ F` (the "red" edges); the "blue" edges are `F \ R`.
