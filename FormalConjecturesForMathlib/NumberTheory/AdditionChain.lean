# Addition chains

An *addition chain* for $n$ is a strictly increasing sequence
$1 = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_r = n$ in which every entry after the first is the sum of two
earlier entries. Its length is $r$, the number of additions, and $\ell(n)$ is the least
length over all chains ending at $n$.

`additionChainLength` is an infimum over `List ℕ`, so an explicit chain bounds it above
(`additionChainLength_le`) but nothing bounds it below until the search is confined. The
confinement here is that an addition step at most doubles, so `r` steps cannot reach past
`2 ^ r` (`getLast_le_two_pow`), giving `lt_additionChainLength_of_two_pow_lt`.

/-- An *addition chain* is a strictly increasing sequence
$1 = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_r$ in which every entry after the first is the sum of two
(not necessarily distinct) earlier entries.

`IsAdditionChain c` asserts that the list $c$ is such a chain: it starts at $1$, is
strictly increasing, and every entry other than $1$ is a sum of two entries of $c$. -/

/-- Every quantifier in `IsAdditionChain` is bounded by the list, so membership is decidable
and a concrete chain can be checked by `decide`. -/
