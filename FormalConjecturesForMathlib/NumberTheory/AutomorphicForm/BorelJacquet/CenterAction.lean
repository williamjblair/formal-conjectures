# The enveloping algebra of `𝔤𝔩 n ℂ`, its centre, and their action

The universal enveloping algebra `U(𝔤𝔩 n ℂ)` of the complexified Lie algebra of `GL n ℝ` and
the action of its centre on the complex-valued `C^∞` functions on `GL n ℝ` by left invariant
differential operators. This is the action that condition (c) in the Borel-Jacquet definition
of an automorphic form refers to; see
`FormalConjecturesForMathlib.NumberTheory.AutomorphicForm.BorelJacquet` for that definition,
and Borel and Jacquet's Corvallis article, the reference below, for its source.

## Main declarations

All in the namespace `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup`:

* `universalEnveloping` and `centerUniversalEnveloping`: `U(𝔤𝔩 n ℂ)` and its centre.
* `lieDerivHom`, `envelopingAction`, `centerAction`: the action of `𝔤𝔩 n ℂ` on `smoothGL n`
  as a homomorphism of Lie algebras, its extension to `U(𝔤𝔩 n ℂ)` by the universal property,
  and the restriction to the centre, which also makes `smoothGL n` a module over the centre.
* `constantsCharacter`: the character by which the centre acts on the line of constant
  functions; its kernel is an ideal of finite codimension annihilating the constants, which
  gives condition (c) for constant automorphic forms.

### Constant functions span an invariant line

Left invariant derivatives kill constants, so the enveloping algebra maps the line of constant
functions to itself, through the character `constantsCharacter`; its kernel is an ideal of
finite codimension annihilating the constants.
