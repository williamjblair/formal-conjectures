# Normal numbers

A real number $x$ is *normal in base* $b$ if every digit
$d \in \{0,1,\dots,b-1\}$ appears with asymptotic frequency $1/b$
in the base-$b$ expansion of $x$.

A number that is normal in every integer base $b \ge 2$
is called *absolutely normal*.

Despite extensive empirical evidence, it remains unknown whether
classical constants such as $\pi$, $e$, or $\sqrt{2}$ are normal in any base.

## Main definitions

* `digitSeq`: the sequence of digits in the base-`b` fractional expansion of a real number.
* `IsNormalInBase`: a real number is normal in base `b`.
* `IsAbsolutelyNormal`: a real number is normal in every base `b ≥ 2`.
