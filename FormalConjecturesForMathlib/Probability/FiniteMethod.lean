# The finite probabilistic method (averaging / pigeonhole primitive)

This file provides the core averaging lemma underlying the elementary form of Erdős's
**probabilistic method**:

> If the sum of a `ℕ`-valued function `f` over a finite set `s` is strictly less than the
> cardinality of `s`, then `f` vanishes somewhere on `s`.

Interpreting `f a` as "the number of bad configurations caused by choice `a`", and sampling
`a` uniformly from `s`, the expected number of bad configurations is `(∑ f) / |s| < 1`,
so there must exist at least one `a ∈ s` with `f a = 0`.

This is used by:
- `FormalConjectures/Probabilistic/RamseyDiagonalLowerBound.lean`
  to close the `R(k,k) > 2^{k/2}` lower bound (Erdős 1947).
- downstream deletion-method / alteration-method arguments.

Both the `ℕ`-form and a convenience `ℝ`-form are provided; the latter is useful when the
expectation bound is derived via `rpow`/`log` manipulations on the reals and only later
cast back to counting.

/-- **Finite probabilistic method (integer form).**

If `∑ x ∈ s, f x < s.card`, then there exists `a ∈ s` with `f a = 0`.

**Proof idea.** Contrapositive: if every value is at least `1`, the sum is at least
`s.card · 1 = s.card`, contradicting the hypothesis. -/

/-- **Finite probabilistic method (real form).**

If `(∑ x ∈ s, (f x : ℝ)) < s.card`, then there exists `a ∈ s` with `f a = 0`.

This is the same statement as `Finset.exists_eq_zero_of_sum_lt_card` after casting the
counting inequality to `ℝ`; it is the convenient entry point when `f` arises as an expectation
whose bound was computed in the reals (e.g. via `Real.rpow` / `Real.log`). -/
