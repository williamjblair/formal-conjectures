# Formal Conjectures to LeanEval adapter

This directory contains the Formal Conjectures side of the integration with
[`leanprover/lean-eval`](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval) and
[`leanprover/comparator`](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator), following
the ownership split proposed in
[`lean-eval#536`](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval/pull/536), with
coordination tracked in
[`lean-eval#533`](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-eval/issues/533) and
[`formal-conjectures#4930`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/issues/4930).

**[`OWNERSHIP.md`](OWNERSHIP.md) is the map**: which code is Formal
Conjectures' permanently, which code is standing in for
`leanprover/lean-eval-generator` and is deleted when that lands, what crosses
between them, and what the interface still needs from lean-eval. Read it first.
This file is the operator's page: the commands, their inputs, and the pins.

## Two toolchains

Formal Conjectures elaborates its own source under its own pinned toolchain.
LeanEval is the benchmark host: an imported problem is built and checked under
LeanEval's pinned Lean 4.33 and matching Mathlib. Supporting the integration
does not require a repository-wide toolchain upgrade here.

So the importer reads a declaration's source range, binders, dependencies and
`answer(sorry)` slot types from an environment elaborated at *this*
repository's toolchain, and the workspace it produces is pinned to *LeanEval's*
toolchain and Mathlib. `manifest.json` records both pin sets, under `source`
and `target`. `.github/workflows/comparator-lean-4-33.yml` generates a
workspace here and builds and Comparator-checks it there, in one job, which is
what turns the gap between them into something observed rather than assumed.

## Generate one workspace

```bash
python3 scripts/make_comparator_workspace.py erdos_940.variants.large_integers
```

Use `--out` to choose the parent directory. Generation refuses to overwrite an
existing workspace: it writes into a temporary directory and renames the
complete workspace into place.

The importer stops when the selected source differs from the pinned upstream
revision. This prevents a workspace from combining a working-tree statement
with an older imported context.

`--verify` elaborates the marked-up module before anything is written, so an
FC-side copying defect fails here rather than in LeanEval CI. It runs at this
repository's Lean and Mathlib, so it is not evidence about the 4.33 build.

The workspace contains `ChallengeDeps.lean` with the statement's copied Formal
Conjectures closure, `Challenge.lean` with the trusted statement and its proof
hole, `Submission.lean` and `Submission/` where a solver works, `Solution.lean`
connecting the two, `config.json` with the theorem targets, definition targets
and permitted axioms, and `manifest.json`. `Solution.lean` is fixed: it fails
to build if the submission changes the statement. Comparator rejects `sorryAx`,
because it is not in the permitted axiom list.

### Emit only what this repository owns

```bash
python3 scripts/make_comparator_workspace.py erdos_1038.parts.i \
  --emit-import .comparator-import
```

This writes `Problem.lean` and `manifest.json` and generates no workspace. It
is the pair the importer contributes to a LeanEval problem pull request once
the shared generator is a pinned dependency there.

### Supported inputs

- theorem proofs;
- definition answers represented by `answer(sorry)`;
- helper modules under `Submission/`.

Plain-statement disproofs remain out of scope until Comparator provides an
upstream interface for them.

The importer fails closed on ambiguous declarations, source drift, inaccessible
binders, unsupported dependencies, answer-slot types that cannot be matched
safely, and existing output.

## Problem files

`problems/*.toml` is an input, not the LeanEval manifest: it records the
choices this repository's Lean source cannot make for itself, and the importer
reads it. The manifest the generator receives, and writes into the workspace as
`manifest.json`, is derived.

Most declarations need no problem file. Add one TOML file under `problems/`
only when the source cannot select the declaration by itself.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Workspace name. It must match the TOML filename. |
| `declaration` | Lean declaration name. |
| `module` | Source file when the declaration name is ambiguous. |
| `answer_type` | Explicit override when slot types cannot be matched safely. |
| `source` | Optional source link for the generated README. |
| `notes` | Optional reviewer note for the generated README. |

Run the problem-file check after moving or renaming a declaration:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_comparator_workspace.py --validate
```

## Tool pins

`tools.toml` is the one machine-readable source. `[tools]` are the revisions a
local run uses under this repository's toolchain. `[target]` are LeanEval's:
the Lean toolchain and Mathlib revision every generated workspace is pinned to,
and the Comparator and `lean4export` commits that check it. Every manifest
records `[target]` beside the source pins. Generation itself does not run
Comparator.

## Conformance before a public import

The adapter should cover these boundary cases before importing a frozen set:

- a plain theorem proof;
- a `Prop`-valued `answer(sorry)` slot;
- a non-`Prop` answer slot;
- explicit declaration parameters versus `∀` binders in the conclusion;
- trusted helper dependencies requiring `ChallengeDeps` or multiple trusted
  files.

The two CI jobs exercise those distinctions: `build-and-docs.yml` generates
five declarations covering each case and checks the importer-to-generator seam,
and `comparator-lean-4-33.yml` builds two of them at LeanEval's pins and runs
Comparator on them. They validate extraction and adapter behaviour, not
mathematical correctness or maintainer acceptance.

The first public open-conjectures import also needs a corrected source set.
`FC100OpenSet1` currently verifies itself as 92 `research open` entries and 8
`research solved` entries, so it must not be imported wholesale as one hundred
open conjectures.
