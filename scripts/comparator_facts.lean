The elaborator-side facts `scripts/fc_leaneval_importer.py` would otherwise
get by reading Lean with regular expressions.

Given a module and a declaration name, this prints JSON with what the
elaborated environment knows exactly and the text layer can only guess:

- the declaration's source range, for slicing its original text;
- its binders, with names and explicitness, for the Solution adapter;
- the type of each `sorry` inside the *statement*, which is the type of an
  `answer(sorry)` slot. The `answer_type` field in a `comparator/problems`
  file exists only because surface syntax does not carry this; the
  environment does.

Usage:
  lake exe comparator_facts <Module> <declaration>

The declaration may be given in full or by any whole suffix, the same rule
the Python importer uses.

`theorem foo (n : Nat) : P n` lambda-abstracts `n` in its proof value;
`theorem foo : ∀ n : Nat, P n` does not. Only the former are applied by the
generated Solution adapter, and `forallTelescope` alone cannot tell them
apart: the lambda arity of the (sorry) value can. lean-eval's extractor
draws the same line for the same reason. -/
