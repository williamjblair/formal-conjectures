"""Turn a marked-up module and a manifest into a Challenge/Solution workspace.

**This file is the placeholder for a dependency, and it is meant to be
deleted.** `leanprover/lean-eval#536` extracts lean-eval's generator core into
`leanprover/lean-eval-generator`, consumed as a pinned dependency by lean-eval
and by this importer, and says in as many words that the Formal Conjectures
importer does not fork the generation logic. Until that repository exists there
is nothing to pin, so this module stands in for it, deliberately holding
everything that is not Formal Conjectures' to own:

- the workspace layout and every file emitted into it;
- which generated module imports which, and where the scope directives are
  restated so the same statement text elaborates in all three files;
- the lakefile, the toolchain file and the Mathlib requirement;
- the fixed Solution adapter that pins the statement;
- the Comparator `config.json` shape.

It reads nothing from this repository except the marked-up module, the
manifest, and the workspace test template it copies. It never resolves a
declaration, reads Lean source, or runs Lean. When `lean-eval-generator` lands,
this file is deleted, `generate` becomes a call into the pinned package, and
`scripts/fc_leaneval_importer.py` does not change.

See `comparator/OWNERSHIP.md` for the line counts either side of that deletion.
