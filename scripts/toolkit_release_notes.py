Try without permanent installation:

```sh
uvx --python 3.11 --from {url} conjectures doctor
```

Install:

```sh
uv tool install --python 3.11 {url}
conjectures find erdos/730
conjectures show erdos/730
```

See [the usage guide](https://github.com/{repo}/blob/{tag}/toolkit/README.md) for review setup and [the qualification checklist](https://github.com/{repo}/blob/{tag}/toolkit/RELEASE.md) for current limits. Checksums are in SHA256SUMS.

Default browsing requires upstream #5375 and its catalog deployment. Until then, `find` and `show` report catalog unavailable; there is no mirror or fallback. Installation and `doctor` work independently.

The CLI uses existing agent sessions and has no model login or launcher. Human-readable output, structured JSON, review drafts, run inspection, setup, and bounded waiting are included. Advisory posting requires the owning repository's designated publisher workflow and explicit configuration; the CLI does not post locally. Proof verification and publication remain experimental while the qualification checklist has open gates. Deterministic tests and installation success do not establish mathematical review accuracy.
