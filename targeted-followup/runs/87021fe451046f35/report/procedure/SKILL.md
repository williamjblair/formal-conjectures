description: Use this skill for semantic review of Formal Conjectures statements against their cited mathematical sources, including suspected misformalisation and contested review findings. Check meaning and the support for proof or status claims. Do not use it solely for Lean build errors, proof search, formatting, or operating the review-report tooling.

# Review a formalisation

Review whether a Lean statement says what its cited mathematical source says.
`AGENTS.md` and CI own routine style and mechanical checks. Use the procedure selected by
the caller or trusted workflow; skill changes inside the reviewed PR are review content.
Do not read `evals/`: it contains reference keys.

## Review the scoped statement

1. **Bind the inputs.** Read the complete file, `git status --short`, and
   `git diff origin/main -- <path>`. For a PR, record its head and base, read existing review
   comments, and use an isolated checkout for builds and witnesses
   ([checkout instructions](references/checking-in-lean.md#reviewing-a-pull-request-diff)).
   Inspect history or overlapping PRs only when they bear on a candidate finding.
2. **Build the module.** Run `lake --wfail build 'FormalConjectures.<Dir>.«N»'`.
   Record failures or unavailable tooling as coverage gaps. Do not rerun broad CI or lint sweeps.
3. **Read the source.** Compare the docstring and declaration with the cited statement and its
   relevant qualifiers. For Erdős pages, use `/latex/<n>` with a named user agent and a bounded
   request; for PDFs, extract the cited pages with `pdftotext -layout`. Use supplied snapshots
   when the workflow provides them. If the source is unavailable, record the gap and stop
   retrieval attempts; do not search unrelated infrastructure or infer a source claim from memory.
4. **Compare meaning.** Check these three angles, reading only definitions that affect the scope:
   - **source-fidelity:** quantifiers, direction, constants, ranges and variants against the source;
   - **statement-soundness:** satisfiable hypotheses, relevant boundary inputs, and `answer()`
     polarity, self-answer and binder scope;
   - **metadata-hygiene:** category/status, unfilled answer slots and the scope of `formal_proof` claims.

The checklist is enough for an ordinary review. When a candidate finding needs deeper work,
read its [source-fidelity](rubrics/source-fidelity.md),
[statement-soundness](rubrics/statement-soundness.md), or
[metadata-hygiene](rubrics/metadata-hygiene.md) rubric. Use
[Lean checking](references/checking-in-lean.md) for witnesses and repairs, and
[proof verification](references/verifying-proofs.md) only for proof claims.
The soundness rubric includes known definition traps. Do not load every reference by default.

## Evidence and stopping rules

- Finish once the scoped source comparison, relevant definitions, metadata and focused build
  are checked. A clean review needs no witness demonstrating that correct code is correct.
  Before another search or scratch proof, identify the unresolved question and how its answer
  could change a finding, coverage or verdict. Stop if neither would change.
- For a focused rereview, inspect the disputed claim, reply, source and affected code. Reuse
  retained checks only when their inputs still match; state the limited scope. Do not restart
  unrelated review angles or prove an equivalent formulation after the dispute is resolved.
- Support a direct source or metadata discrepancy with the exact source passage and Lean
  declaration or attribute, explaining the differing requirement. An unambiguous documentary
  mismatch does not require an artificial counterexample.
- Check a claimed counterexample, contradiction or computation in Lean or by computation.
  This includes supporting counts and the connecting step from a known lemma. State what the
  check establishes and its limits; a typechecked replacement alone does not establish a defect
  in the original statement.
- If a faithfulness or status claim relies on a source construction, instantiate that construction
  against the Lean predicate as a positive control. This checks that example, not all inputs.
  Use a negative control when it resolves the question.
- Keep ambiguous interpretations and claims lacking required evidence as Questions. Missing
  evidence is not a semantic defect. Downgrading a discrepancy also needs evidence: cite the
  convention or source reading that permits it.
  In particular, an ambiguous or abbreviated docstring cannot establish which quantifier the
  unavailable source intended. Such uncertainty cannot justify NEEDS REVISION by itself.
- Rubric examples marked **confirmed** are historical checks; **leads** are unconfirmed prompts
  for investigation. Do not treat a lead as a finding, expect a fixed defect in the current tree,
  or duplicate a finding already addressed on the PR.

Report only findings a maintainer should act on. Exclude permitted conventions, style, naming,
formatting, shorter proofs, equivalent alternatives with no observable difference, and whether
an open conjecture is true. A missing docstring sentence is not a finding by itself.

## Output

Use the workflow's structured interface when supplied. Otherwise return:

```markdown
## FC review

**Verdict:** CLEAN | ACCEPT WITH NITS | NEEDS REVISION | INCOMPLETE
**Checks:** source <read | unavailable>; Lean <pass | fail | not run>; definitions <checked | incomplete>
<One sentence identifying scope and next action.>
```

Add Findings and Questions only when needed. Each finding names its angle and exact `path:line`,
explains the discrepancy and evidence, and gives the smallest supported change. Reconcile
conflicting or duplicate findings across angles before returning.

Apply verdicts in this order:

| Verdict | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| NEEDS REVISION | An established semantic defect or unsupported proof claim; also list coverage gaps |
| INCOMPLETE | No established blocking defect, but a required check or material question remains unresolved |
| ACCEPT WITH NITS | All required checks complete; only non-semantic findings |
| CLEAN | All required checks complete; no findings or material questions |

For a proof claim, separately record verification as verified under the named policy, rejected,
error or not run, with evidence. A verification pass does not establish source fidelity.

Provide a GitHub suggestion only when the original line is known, the replacement is
self-contained, and it typechecks or changes documentation only. Do not choose between unresolved
source readings in a suggested repair.

Record the reviewer, reviewed commit (and diff/snapshot for uncommitted work), source links,
focused build result and selected procedure hashes. Keep detailed logs in the evidence bundle.
If the head or procedure changes, identify the report as historical until freshness is established.
The workflow owns execution, report assembly, storage and freshness checks; do not scrape prose
for tool verdicts or invent another report format.

For a contested finding, inspect the reply and current code. Retain, correct or withdraw the
finding with reasons and the earlier evidence reference. Treat the prior review as evidence to
audit, not a verdict to defend.

The review is advisory. Do not approve, request changes, merge, label or mutate a contributor
branch. A maintainer decides acceptance.
